## What is Agile? 

In software development world, Agile describes [a set of values and principles in a manifesto]( http://agilemanifesto.org/)[^1]for software development. 

> "We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over **processes and tools**
> **Working software** over **comprehensive documentation**
> **Customer collaboration** over **contract negotiation**
> **Responding to change** over **following a plan**
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more."
>
> -*Manifesto for Agile Software Development*

Besides these fundamental values, the Agile practices approach software development through collaborate effort of teams, and it values elements including fast delivery, flexibility, feedback from end-users, and continuous evolutions.  These values and practices are carried out in lots of software development frameworks. We will touch on one of them, Scrum, in this section later.
