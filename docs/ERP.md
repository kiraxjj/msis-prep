# Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)



**Before entering MSIS, you are expected to know the usage of ERP in the modern business world. It would be optimal if you had some experiences of using an ERP software during your undergraduate study or professional work.**



## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you would have the access to and be practicing on a handful servers of SAP (a very common-used ERP software in modern enterprises). Throughout the course, you would play the role of a business manager and oversee the day-to-day activities of a company using the SAP system.



## SAP 

SAP is one of the leading software in the ERP industry. You will be using SAP to practice those ERP concepts you learn in the ERP module. Right now you may not have access to use it, but feel free to browse over the [SAP's website](https://www.sap.com/index.html). 



## Major Concepts



### What Is ERP? Why Do We Use It? 

ERP, as known as the Enterprise Resource Planning, refers to a type of software that organizations internally implement to monitor, manage and review day-to-day business activities.

### The Historical Purpose of ERPs

The PC revolution has granted a lot of efficiency for modern businesses, but also created gaps, or silos, in between different functional departments. Back in time, companies were having trouble sharing their data. As a response, ERP rose to a powerful integration solution that it solved this problem by allowing the users to better plan and integrate the resources across all departments within the enterprise. If you are interested in the origin of ERP:

> The term ERP was first used in the 1990s by the Gartner Group, but enterprise resource planning systems actually have their roots deep in the manufacturing industry, and can trace their history back to the 1960s.

### The  ERP Data Type

There are essentially four types of data that a company use and store. They are: 

- **Configuration/Organizational Data**
- **Master Data**
- **Transaction Data**
- **Situational Data**

The first three types of data are the most common data one would use and identify. The fourth type, situational data, are data specific to tasks, and they are sometimes mixed with master data and transaction data.

Configuration/Organizational data is very easy to understand, 

Some might find it difficult to tell between master data and transaction data. Here is some great resources to help you understand their differences!

- A great video to start with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv9P5D6yj30
- The author of the above video post this [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/master-data-vs-transaction-jared-hillam/) on his LinkedIn explaining more ways to decipher and mange Master Date vs Transaction Data.

After you have learned about the data types, [this](https://fadyums.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/revision-chapter-2.pdf) is a very useful file where you could find more practical examples of these different types of data. It has some review questions (short answers, multiple choices, T/F) to test your understanding. Do it and test how well you know about **DATA**!



### The Business Activities Cycles

There are 5 major Business Cycles:

1. Procurement cycle (Expense, Purchasing, Procure to Pay)
2. Revenue cycle (Sales, Order to Cash)
3. Production cycle (Manufacturing or Operations)
4. Human Resources / Payroll cycle
5. Accounting Cycle

> Tom Gregory: "The business cycles begin with capturing data/information about a transaction. They end with information output, such as a financial statement or payment (similar to a system). Similar transactions are grouped together to form a business cycle. "

During CORE, you would participate in different business activities of these cycles using SAP. Here, I would focus on introducing the **Procurement Cycle** and the **Revenue Cycle**. There are a lot of good resources online that you could find about other three cycles. You are very welcome to dig into them as knowing them would help you better understand business processes in organizations.
