# Agile

## During the MSIS program

There are many module of MSIS Core that would cover the concept of Agile as it is now a very popular and common software development practice in IT industry. What you would learn from this page will help you gain a good understanding of the fundamentals of Agile development, and prepare you to learn more advanced concept and do hands-on practice with Agile development in the MSIS.

 

## Major Concepts

### Learning Outcome

- [ ] Being able to define Agile, and know what it values.
- [ ] Being able to identify some advantages and disadvantages of Agile.
- [ ] Being able to describe the process of Scrum.
- [ ] Being able to explain the key terms of Scrum methodology that are listed in the exercises.



## What is Agile? 

In software development world, Agile describes [a set of values and principles in a manifesto]( http://agilemanifesto.org/)for software development. 

> "We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
>
> **Individuals and interactions** over **processes and tools**
> **Working software** over **comprehensive documentation**
> **Customer collaboration** over **contract negotiation**
> **Responding to change** over **following a plan**
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more."
>
> -*Manifesto for Agile Software Development*

Besides these fundamental values, the Agile practices approach software development through collaborate effort of teams, and it values elements including fast delivery, flexibility, feedback from end-users, and continuous evolutions.  These values and practices are carried out in lots of software development frameworks. We will touch on one of them, Scrum, in this section later.

Watch this video (~12min) created by Mark Shead, an Agile coach and software engineer,[^1]as the video explains Agile in-depth regarding its values and principals. You should be familiar with the concepts of Agile after watching it.

## Agile Model

As Agile believes that software development projects are unique, Agile models require continuous improvements that are tailored to suit requirements at different stages. When working in the Agile style, teams always divided the project based to small time frames as time boxes to deliver specific features or updates for each release. 

Releases happen at the end of each time box. During a fixed time period, the team would take an iterative approach to try to meet requirement. Every period is also called an iteration. When an iteration is over, developers would communicate with the clients, gather feedback and plan for new features for next iteration.

## Agile: Pros And Cons

Tutorialspoint[^2] offers a free tutorial module on SDLC. On the page ["SDLC - Agile Model"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_agile_model.htm#:~:text=Agile%20SDLC%20model%20is%20a,builds%20are%20provided%20in%20iterations.), the website did a great job explaining Agile and its significance. The website also offers this great list of the pros and cons of Agile model:

Advantages:
>- Is a very realistic approach to software development.
>- Promotes teamwork and cross training.
>- Functionality can be developed rapidly and demonstrated.
>- Resource requirements are minimum.
>- Suitable for fixed or changing requirements
>- Delivers early partial working solutions.
>- Good model for environments that change steadily.
>- Minimal rules, documentation easily employed.
>- Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context.
>- Little or no planning required.
>- Easy to manage.
>- Gives flexibility to developers.

Disadvantages
>- Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.
>- More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
>- An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM practice is a must without which it will not work.
>- Strict delivery management dictates the scope, functionality to be delivered, and adjustments to meet the deadlines.
>- Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction.
>- There is a very high individual dependency, since there is minimum documentation generated.
>- Transfer of technology to new team members may be quite challenging due to lack of documentation.



## Scrum

There are many frameworks for Agile development. In this module, you will be introduced on the Scrum framework, the most popular Agile framework.

### What is Scrum?

In simple words, scrum is an Agile methodology or framework that is widely applied by developers for software development projects. It applies the fundamental values and principals of Agile while it has some additional characteristics such as defined team roles, events and ceremonies, artifacts, and rules.

Read this great article ["What Is Scrum Methodology?"](https://digital.ai/resources/agile-101/what-is-scrum) from digital.ai[^3] as it explains the Scrum methodology quite thoroughly. Pay attention to the following key terms of this framework:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Sprint
- Daily Stand-up
- Retrospective
- Product Backlog



These terms are further explained in this video by Axosoft[^4]. Watch this video to better understand how these elements are practically applied in software development. While you are watching the video, pay attention to the following key terms:

- User story
- Story point

## Exercises

1. Choose the correct Agile value from the below pairs of SDLC values:

   a. Individuals and interactions / Processes and tools
   b. Comprehensive documentation / Working software
   c. Contract negotiation / Customer collaboration
   d. Responding to change / following a plan

   

2. In your own words, define Agile. What is Agile, why should it be used for software development, and where does it shine?

   

3. In your own words, define Scrum. Explain the relationship between Scrum and Agile.

   

4. Define the following key terms:

   - User story 

   - Story point

   - Product Owner

   - Scrum Master

   - Sprint 

     - Typically, how many days does a sprint last?

   - Daily Stand-up

   - Retrospective

   - Product Backlog

     

5. Assume that you are using Agile to develop a software. Try to think of some user stories of your software (at least 5+), and allocate story points to them use T-shirt size.
