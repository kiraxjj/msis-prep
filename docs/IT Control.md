# IT Controls

**Before entering MSIS, you are expected to know the what IT control is, why it is useful, and how is it applied in the companies. You should also be familiar with the concept of Internal Control and some frameworks that related to it.**

## During the MSIS program

This concept would be relative to many modules you would encounter in MSIS Core such as the ERP module and ITGRC module. **IT security is important** and **data is ultra-important** in any topic that's related to IT in the era of Internet.

## Major Concepts

### What is IT Controls

> In [business](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) and [accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting), **information technology controls** (or **IT controls**) are specific activities performed by persons or systems designed to ensure that business objectives are met. They are a subset of an enterprise's [internal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control).

> -Wikipedia

IT control plays critical role in assuring that the IT is correctly used, data is protected, and the organization is in compliance with laws and regulations.

### The Two Categories of IT Controls

There are two categories of IT controls: **IT general controls (ITGC)** and **IT application controls (ITAC)**

- **ITGC:** 
    - the procedures/policies of organizations' control environment processes are stable and well-managed:  [risk management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/enterprise-risk-management.asp), [change management](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/what-is-change-management), [disaster recovery](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/disaster-recovery)  (Skim through these process to grab a basic understanding for now, you should be able to learn more about these processes in ITGRC ==link to ITGRC once built== module.)
    - Example: Security Management Controls

- **ITAC**

    - Prevent, detect, and correct transaction errors and fraud.
    - Concerned area: data accuracy[^accuracy], validity[^validity], integrity[^integrity], and more. 

  [^accuracy]: whether the **data** values stored for an object are the correct values
  [^validity]:the correctness and reasonableness of **data**
  [^integrity]:the completeness, soundness, and wholeness of the **data** that also complies with the intention of the creators of the **data**.

### Types of IT Controls

- Preventive Controls[^Preventive]
- Detective Controls[^Detective]
- Corrective Controls[^Corrective]

[^Preventive]:Deter problems before
[^Detective]:Discover problems after they arise
[^Corrective]: correct and modify system

There are some simple examples for you to understand these control types:

**Preventive**: Lock on door to prevent intruders.

**Detective**: Fire alarm when fire goes off

**Corrective**: House insurance

### Control Frameworks and Organizations

#### [COSO internal control framework](http://www.coso.org/)

The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) issued the **Internal Control Framework** in 1992:

> COSO issued the **Internal Control Framework**:
>
> - Defines internal controls.
>
> - Provides guidance for evaluating and [enhancing ]internal control systems.
>
> - Widely accepted as the authority on internal controls.
>
> - Incorporated into policies, rules, and regulations used to control business activities.
>
> - 10 years later it issued its expanded Enterprise Risk Management [ERM] model. Latest version published in 2017.
>
> - In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of multi-million-dollar accounting frauds made headlines (e.g., ENRON, WorldCom)
>
> - The impact on financial markets was substantial, and Congress responded with passage of the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act** **of 2002**

##### SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002)

> The **intent** of SOX is to:
>
> - Prevent financial statement fraud
> - Make financial reports more transparent
> - Protect investors
> - Strengthen internal controls in publicly-held companies
> - Punish executives who perpetrate fraud
>
> **Importance: ** Sox has had a **material** impact on the way boards of directors, management, and accountants operate.

#### [COBIT Internal Control Framework](www.isaca.org/resources/cobit)

- **COBIT** stands for the Control Objectives for Information and related Technology 
- Developed by the Information Systems Audit and Control Foundation: **ISACA**
- The COBIT framework is of generally applicable information systems security and control practices for IT control.
- Most recent update: COBIT-2019. Below is a graph showing its historical evaluation from 1995 till now.
