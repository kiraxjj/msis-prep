### The Business Activities Cycles

> Tom Gregory: "The business cycles begin with capturing data/information about a transaction. They end with information output, such as a financial statement or payment (similar to a system). Similar transactions are grouped together to form a business cycle. "

There are 5 major Business Cycles:

1. Procurement cycle (Expense, Purchasing, Procure to Pay)
2. Revenue cycle (Sales, Order to Cash)
3. Production cycle (Manufacturing or Operations)
4. Human Resources / Payroll cycle
5. Accounting Cycle

During the CORE, you would participate in different business activities of these cycles using SAP. Here, I would focus on introducing the **Procurement Cycle** and the **Revenue Cycle**. There are a lot of good resources online that you could find about other three cycles. You are very welcome to dig into them as knowing them would help you better understand business processes in organizations.

Read about the Procurement Cycle: 

[*Procurement Cycle (The Telegraph)*](https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/procurement-cycle/ )

From [the Telegraph article](https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/procurement-cycle/ ) above, you could find that there are many important documents that are involved in the procurement cycle. You would find it helpful in the future if you could gain a basic understanding of them right now. They are:

1. Purchase Order: prepared by the **buyer** when ordering goods or services

2. Goods Receipt: prepared by the **buyer** when taking physical possession of goods

3. Invoice / Bill: prepared by the **seller** and sent to the **buyer**

4. Check (Payment): Prepared by the **buyer** and given to the **seller**, usually accompanied by a remittance advice to seller knows where to apply the payment

- #### Sales Cycle (Order-to-Cash)

Read [this article](https://trackmaven.com/marketing-dictionary/sales-cycle/#:~:text=The%20sales%20cycle%20is%20the,on%20how%20they%20define%20it.) to learn about Sales Cycle:

> The sales cycle is the process that companies undergo when selling a product to a customer. It encompasses all activities associated with closing sale. Many companies have different steps and activities in their sales cycle, depending on how they define it.

Below are two more detailed websites explaining the stages and documents that are involved. Pay attention again to each step as they would generate documents that are essential for firms:

The documents that are generated from the sales cycle are:

1. Sales Order: typically a reflection of (and response to) the Purchase Order
2. Packing Slip: accompanies the goods and usually omits $ dollar amount as an internal control measure *(pause a second to think here: why does packing slip omit the dollar amount? Do some research!)*
3. Invoice (Bill): Prepared by the **Selling company**
4. Payment Receipt: produced by the **Seller** and/or may be reported on a monthly statement of account.



*Note: You are encouraged to look online for examples of the above documents if you don't know what they might look like.*
